taskYIELD() is used to request a context switch to another task.
However, if there are no other tasks at a higher or equal priority to the task that calls taskYIELD() 
then the RTOS scheduler will simply select the task that called taskYIELD() to run again.

If configUSE_PREEMPTION is set to 1 then the RTOS scheduler will always be running 
the highest priority task that is able to run, so calling taskYIELD() will never result in a switch to a higher priority task.
